                First and foremost, this is a real working website. Yes, the inventory is real, the shopping cart, payment information and all other functions work. <em>If you buy something and proceed through the shopping cart,</em> you will be charged, and I will ship it. Please read through the <Link to='/FAQ'>FAQs</Link> if you have general questions about how this site works.

            <p class="text-light my-3">
                I am a web developer.  This website is a project to represent my knowledge in React.  Without going into much detail as to what React is (for the non-coders in the house), a great way to get practice in this coding framework is through a commerce website. Use it as an example of what I can do for you in your personal website. For the coders, this project uses React, Node JS, and Bootstrap.

                Where did all these clothes and items come from, you ask? In my college days, between 2006-2012, I worked in a clothing store in the mall.  As such, I had access to all the latest fashion! As you may remember, the 2000s was a crazy time for hip-hop.  We liked our clothes with extra breathing room. Many of the clothes are much bigger than I can ever hope to fit ðŸ¤£ ! What this means to you is, most are extremely lightly worn. Because they've always been in such good condition, I have been reluctant to throw them away.  I've always intended to sell them at the flea market, but I have no desire to wheel & deal, haggle and negotiate.
